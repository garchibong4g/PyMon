# PyMon

PyMon is a real-time monitoring system that uses an Arduino Uno with DS18B20 and INA219 sensors to track temperature, voltage, and current.  
Live sensor data is streamed and visualized through a Python-based interface, enabling efficient system monitoring and analysis.

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. Arduino reads temperature, voltage, and current data from connected sensors.
2. Sensor readings are transmitted to the computer via USB serial communication.
3. Python receives and parses incoming serial data.
4. Data is processed and visualized in real time.
5. Live numerical values and plots are displayed to the user.
